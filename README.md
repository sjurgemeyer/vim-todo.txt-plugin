vim-todo.txt-plugin
===================

This is a VIM plugin for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) which adds the following convenience methods.

SortByDate (Leader-t): if you have dates from todo.txt plugins such as schedule in the format t:yyyy-MM-dd, sort by those dates
SortByContext (Leader-c): Sort by context name
SortByProject (Leader-p): Sort by project name

Since todo.txt doesn't seem to care about blank lines, this will place blank lines in between differing items.
